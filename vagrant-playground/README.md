Simply run:
```console
vagrant up
```
The command creates a new VM based on the Vagrantfile and then provisions it with the playbook.yml. <br>
The provisioning process only **performs a connection verification to a local VM**. It is encouraged to keep everything as being stated to ensure the result, but it is up to you to modify the Vagrantfile and/or playbooks.yml to see things work differently.
